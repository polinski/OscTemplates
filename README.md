# OscTemplates

- quick template to try and build things more sensibly. The Unity template has an 'OscIO' prefab that contains easily asscessible scripts to send OSC out and to parse incoming OSC, which it then spits out as Delegate Events.

- Also has a log which displays incoming OSC from Max and input field to send test OSC back to Max.

- the max patch needs the CNMAT externals installed: http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads
